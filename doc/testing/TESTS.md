## Using pytest to test the app

---

Pytest is one of the testing tools that i'm most familiarized, if you ever want to run tests you will need to install it in your virtual environment, and then just run "pytest" in your console to see the tests that were made for testing the logic and the functionality that the script has.

With pytest, i can easilly use temporary directories and files without fearing that will be residues in my computer, there i can test how the program writes and modifies the environment variable that i'm setting in.
